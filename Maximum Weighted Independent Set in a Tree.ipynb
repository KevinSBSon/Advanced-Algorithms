You’d like to invite the coolest people, and you’ve assigned each one of them a fun factor — the more the fun factor, the cooler is the person. You want to maximize the total fun factor (sum of the fun factors of all the invited people). However, you can’t invite everyone, because if the direct boss of some invited person is also invited, it will be awkward. Find out what is the maximum possible total fun factor.\n","<br><br>**Input Format**<br>\n","The first line contains an integer 𝑛 — the number of people in the company. The next line contains 𝑛 numbers 𝑓𝑖 — the fun factors of each of the 𝑛 people in the company. Each of the next 𝑛 − 1 lines describes the subordination structure. Everyone but for the CEO of the company has exactly one direct boss. There are no cycles: nobody can be a boss of a boss of a ... of a boss of himself. So, the subordination structure is a regular tree. Each of the 𝑛 − 1 lines contains two integers 𝑢 and 𝑣, and you know that either 𝑢 is the boss of 𝑣 or vice versa (you don’t really need to know which one is the boss, but you can invite only one of them or none of them).\n","<br><br>**Constraints**<br>\n","1≤𝑛≤100000 ; 1≤𝑓𝑖 ≤1000 ; 1≤𝑢 , 𝑣≤𝑛 ; 𝑢̸=𝑣.\n","<br><br>**Output Format**<br>\n","Output the maximum possible total fun factor of the party (the sum of fun factors of all\n","the invited people)."],"metadata":{"id":"zVlhxWm1jwuQ"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"KpaMIAOrjmxq"},"outputs":[],"source":["import sys\n","import threading\n","\n","# To avoid stack overflow issues\n","sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6) \n","threading.stack_size(2**26)  \n","\n","class Vertex:\n","    def __init__(self, weight):\n","        self.weight = weight\n","        self.children = []\n","\n","\n","def ReadTree():\n","    global size\n","    print(\"Input: \")\n","    size = int(input())\n","    tree = [Vertex(w) for w in map(int, input().split())]\n","    for i in range(1, size):\n","        a, b = list(map(int, input().split()))\n","        tree[a - 1].children.append(b - 1)\n","        tree[b - 1].children.append(a - 1)\n","    return tree\n","\n","D = []\n","parent = []\n","\n","def FunParty(v, tree):\n","    global D, parent\n","    m0 = 0\n","    m1 = 0\n","    m1Fun = 0\n","    if D[v] == float('inf'):\n","        if (len(tree[v].children) == 1) and (v != 0):\n","            D[v] = tree[v].weight\n","        else:\n","            m1 = tree[v].weight\n","            for x in tree[v].children:\n","                if parent[x] ==-1:\n","                    parent[x] = v\n","                if parent[x] == v:\n","                    for y in tree[x].children:\n","                        if parent[y] ==-1:\n","                            parent[y] = x\n","                        if parent[y] == x:\n","                            m1Fun = FunParty(y, tree)\n","                            m1 = m1 + m1Fun\n","            for x in tree[v].children:\n","                if parent[x] == v:\n","                    m0 = m0 + FunParty(x, tree)\n","            D[v] = max(m0, m1)\n","    return D[v]\n","\n","def MaxWeightIndependentTreeSubset(tree):\n","    global size, D, parent\n","    size = len(tree)\n","    if size == 0:\n","        return 0\n","\n","    for i in range(len(D)):\n","        if D[i] == float('inf'):\n","            FunParty(i, tree)\n","    result = max(D)\n","    return result"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Run Code**"],"metadata":{"id":"LnB9KxRFl68b"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["global size, D, parent\n","tree = ReadTree();\n","D = [float('inf') for i in range(size)]\n","parent = [-1 for i in range(size)]\n","parent[0] = -2\n","weight = MaxWeightIndependentTreeSubset(tree);\n","print(\"Output: \\n\", weight)\n","#threading.Thread(target=main).start()"],"metadata":{"id":"3xOI3mc9l5Oz"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
